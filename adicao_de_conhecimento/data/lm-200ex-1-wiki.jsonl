Introduced in the show 's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City , Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled , inexperienced daddy 's girl into a successful businesswoman . During the show 's second season , the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross , with whom she maintains a complicated on-again , off-again relationship throughout the entire series . Together , the characters have a daughter , Emma .   The role of Rachel was originally offered to actresses T\u00e9a Leoni , the producer 's first choice , and Courteney Cox , both of whom declined , Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth , and Cox in favor of playing Rachel 's best friend Monica in Friends . A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms , Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live . After acquiring the role and before Friends aired , Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom , Muddling Through , at the time , which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends .   Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends decade-long run , with The A.V. Club attributing much of the show 's early success to the character . However , some of her storylines have been criticized , specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey during season ten . Rachel 's popularity established her as the show 's breakout character , who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all-time , while the character 's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own . Named the `` Rachel '' after her , the character 's shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history , in spite of Aniston 's own resentment towards it . Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s . Meanwhile , the character 's relationship with Ross is often cited among television 's most beloved .   Rachel is considered to be Aniston 's breakout role , credited with making her the show 's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career . Praised for her performance as Rachel , Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series -- Comedy Or Musical .

Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and spent his entire reign securing it . Upon the death of her father , Saxony , Prussia , Bavaria , and France all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime . Frederick II of Prussia -LRB- who became Maria Theresa 's greatest enemy for most of her reign -RRB- promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia in the nine-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession .

{"id": "Global_warming", "text": "Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -LRB- UNFCCC -RRB- ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese -LRB- whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions -RRB- among the least concerned . "}

Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through `` branding , '' which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers . On the other hand , ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct response advertising . Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties , interest groups , religious organizations and governmental agencies . Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion , such as a public service announcement .

West Virginia is the 9th smallest by area , is ranked 38th in population , and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States . The capital and largest city is Charleston .   West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861 , in which delegates from some Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia during the American Civil War , although they included many secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key Civil War border state . West Virginia was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states formed during the American Civil War -LRB- the other being Nevada -RRB- .

After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States , poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur 's status in the UK .   Under threat of being dropped by Food Records , for their next album Blur underwent an image makeover championed by frontman Damon Albarn .

It is the ancient language of the Vedas of Hinduism , texts compiled over the period of the mid-2nd to mid-1st millennium BCE . It was orally preserved , predating the advent of Brahmi script by several centuries . Vedic Sanskrit is an archaic language , whose consensus translation has been challenging .   Extensive ancient literature in the Vedic Sanskrit language has survived into the modern era , and this has been a major source of information about Indo-European parent language . Quite early in the pre-historic era , Sanskrit separated from the Avestan language -LRB- an Eastern Iranian language -RRB- . The exact century of separation is unknown but this separation of Sanskrit and Avestan occurred certainly before 1800 BCE . Avestan language developed in ancient Persia , was the language of Zoroastrianism , but was a dead language in the Sasanian period . Vedic Sanskrit developed independently in ancient India , evolved into classical Sanskrit after the grammar and linguistic treatise of P\u0101\u1e47ini , and later into many related Indian subcontinent languages in which are found the voluminous ancient and medieval literature of Buddhism , Hinduism and Jainism .

The song was written by James Banks , Eddie Marion and Henderson Thigpen , who had previously written hits for Little Milton , the Bar-Kays and other Stax Records artists . According to Thigpen , he and Banks were brainstorming ideas for songs at Stax Studio -LRB- quote :-RRB- `` trying to come up with ... something different . When people get serious , they say : ` Hey , let 's talk man to man ' ... We thought it would be interesting to have a song with somebody coming up -LSB- with -RSB- : ` Hey , let 's talk woman to woman ' . '' Thigpen had recently overheard his wife on the phone arguing with a friend about an involved couple of their acquaintance , and - with Eddie Marion - Thigpen and Banks completed their `` Woman to Woman '' song structuring it as a phone call from a wife to her husband 's mistress .   `` Woman to Woman '' was first offered to Inez Foxx , then signed to Stax 's Volt label , who turned it down because - according to Banks - she did n't want to do the spoken intro , feeling that format could only work for a male singer . Around this time Shirley Brown was introduced to Stax president Jim Stewart by Albert King in whose live revue she 'd performed while a teenager : Stewart was impressed enough by Brown to himself produce her Stax debut recording - Stewart 's first production task in two years - of `` Woman to Woman '' -LRB- Stewart co-produced the track with Al Jackson Jr. -RRB- with Brown cutting her vocal in a single take . Brown would state in a 1975 interview -LRB- quote :-RRB- `` The guys who wrote -LSB- ` Woman to Woman ' -RSB- sang it through to me and I felt it needed a rap to begin it , so I wrote one off the top of my head '' ; however the song 's co-writer James Banks has stated that the spoken intro was part of the song when it was offered to Inez Foxx , whose dislike of the `` rap '' caused her to turn the song down .   Reportedly selling a million units in its first eight weeks of release , `` Woman to Woman '' spent two weeks at # 1 on Billboard magazine 's Hot Soul Singles chart in November 1974 and crossed-over to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking there at # 22 . The song is notable for being the last big hit for Stax Records .   In 1978 , a C&W rendition of `` Woman to Woman '' provided a hit for Barbara Mandrell , peaking at # 4 on the Billboard magazine C&W chart and crossing over to # 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 , marking Mandrell 's first Hot 100 appearance -LRB- `` Woman to Woman '' was also Mandrell 's first single to rank on the Billboard Adult Contemporary -LRB- aka Easy Listening -RRB- chart , where it peaked at # 49 -RRB- . Mandrell 's rendition maintained the spoken intro as heard on Brown 's , with the modification that as spoken by Mandrell the intro mentions no personal names whereas Brown had opened with : `` Hello may I speak to Barbara ? Barbara , this is Shirley '' .   In 1994 , a cover by Jewell featured on the soundtrack to the film Murder Was the Case starring Snoop Doggy Dogg . Jewell 's version sampled Shirley Brown 's original and peaked at # 16 on the R&B chart and # 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 .   In 1975 Barbara Mason had a hit with `` From His Woman to You '' which was an answer song to `` Woman to Woman '' , the line `` Barbara this is Shirley '' from Brown 's recording being spliced on to the opening of Mason 's recording .

{"id": "Pulmonary_embolism", "text": "Pulmonary embolism -LRB- PE -RRB- is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has traveled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream -LRB- embolism -RRB- . Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath , chest pain particularly upon breathing in , and coughing up blood . Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present such as a red , warm , swollen , and painful leg . Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels , rapid breathing , rapid heart rate , and sometimes a mild fever . Severe cases can lead to passing out , abnormally low blood pressure , and sudden death .   PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung . The risk of blood clots is increased by cancer , prolonged bed rest , smoking , stroke , certain genetic conditions , estrogen-based medication , pregnancy , obesity , and after some types of surgery . A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air , fat , or amniotic fluid . Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results . If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer will rule out the condition . Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography , lung ventilation/perfusion scan , or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis . Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism -LRB- VTE -RRB- .   Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery , lower leg exercises during periods of sitting , and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery . Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin . Often these are recommended for six months or longer . Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator -LRB- tPA -RRB- , or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy . If blood thinners are not appropriate , a vena cava filter may be used .   Pulmonary emboli affect about 430,000 people each year in Europe . In the United States between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year , which results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths . Rates are similar in males and females .

{"id": "American_Civil_War", "text": "The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865 . After a long standing controversy over slavery and state 's rights , war broke out in April 1861 , when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected . The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States of America advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas .   Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America . The Confederacy grew to include eleven states ; it claimed two more border states -LRB- Kentucky and Missouri -RRB- , the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the Union 's western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country -LRB- although Britain and France granted it belligerent status -RRB- . The states that remained loyal , including the border states where slavery was legal , were known as the Union or the North .   The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . During this time many innovations in warfare occurred , including the development and use of iron-clad ships , ultimately changing naval strategy around the world . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the battle of Appomattox , which triggered a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead , a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined , and much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era -LRB- 1863 -- 1877 -RRB- overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is arguably the most studied and written about episode in American history . "}

{"id": "Colosseum", "text": "The Colosseum or Coliseum -LRB- -LSB- k\u0252l\u0259\u02c8si\u02d0\u0259m -RSB- -RRB- , also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre -LRB- Latin : Amphitheatrum Flavium ; Italian : Anfiteatro Flavio -LSB- a\u014bfite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo -RSB- or Colosseo -LSB- kolos\u02c8s\u025b\u02d0o -RSB- -RRB- , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome , Italy . Built of concrete and sand , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian -LRB- 81 -- 96 -RRB- . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name -LRB- Flavius -RRB- .   The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles -LRB- for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities -RRB- , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine .   Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum .   The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin .   The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum -LRB- with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar -RRB- , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli -LRB- modern Pozzuoli -RRB- .   The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby -LRB- the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes -RRB- . This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios -LRB- Sol -RRB- or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome .   In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colis\u00e6us , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus -LRB- `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' -RRB- . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus -LRB- as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage -RRB- . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .   The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma .   The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul -LRB- Romanian -RRB- , le Colis\u00e9e -LRB- French -RRB- , el Coliseo -LRB- Spanish -RRB- and o Coliseu -LRB- Portuguese -RRB- .

{"id": "Vampire", "text": "A vampire is a being from folklore that subsists by feeding on the life essence -LRB- generally in the form of blood -RRB- of the living . In European folklore , vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive . They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance , markedly different from today 's gaunt , pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century .   Vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures ; the term vampire , previously an arcane subject , was popularised in the West in the early 19th century , after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent , such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe ; local variants were also known by different names , such as shtriga in Albania , vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania . This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism .   In modern times , the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity , although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures . Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body 's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this , creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death . Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure , but has since been largely discredited .   The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of The Vampyre by John Polidori ; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century . Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend . The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre , still popular in the 21st century , with books , films , and television shows . The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre . "}

Stoker 's use of the term refers only to vampires , and the extension to other types of supernatural beings arose later .

Best known for creating the animated comedy South Park , Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez , the co-composer/co-lyricist of Avenue Q , and , subsequently , Frozen .   The Book of Mormon follows two Mormon missionaries as they attempt to share their scriptures with the inhabitants of a remote Ugandan village . The earnest young men are challenged by the lack of interest of the locals , who are preoccupied with more pressing troubles such as AIDS , famine , and oppression from the local warlord .   In 2003 , Trey Parker , Robert Lopez , and Matt Stone began developing the musical , meeting sporadically for several years after Parker and Stone saw Avenue Q. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado , and references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been commonplace in their previous works . For research , the trio took a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with current and former Mormon missionaries . Beginning in 2008 , developmental workshops were staged .

{"id": "Camden,_New_Jersey", "text": "Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey . Camden is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344 . -LSB- 10 -RSB- -LSB- 12 -RSB- -LSB- 13 -RSB- Camden is the 12th most populous municipality in New Jersey . The city was incorporated on February 13 , 1828 . On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became a county seat in New Jersey . -LSB- 25 -RSB- The city derives its name from Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- 27 -RSB- Camden is made up of over twenty different neighborhoods .   By the end of the nineteenth century Camden began to industrialize with the foundation of the Campbell Soup Company by Joseph Campbell . Other companies such as the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and the Victor Talking Machine Company opened their operations and helped Camden move into an industrial economy . At the beginning of the twentieth century Camden 's population consisted mostly of European immigrants . German , British , and Irish immigrants , as well as African Americans from the south made up the majority of the city in the mid nineteenth century . Around the turn of the twentieth century Italian and Eastern European immigrants had become the majority of the population .   The city was consistently prosperous throughout the Great Depression and World War II . After World War II Camden manufacturers began closing their factories and moving out of the city . Camden 's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years . With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp decline in population numbers . Suburbanization also had an effect on the drop in population . Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden with the decline in population . In 1971 , civil unrest reached its peak with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez , a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two white police officers .   Camden 's industrial and post-industrial history gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the status of the city over the course of the 20th century . Over the years Camden has made many attempts to restore its economic stature . In the 1980s Mayor Randy Primas campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries : a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator . Despite opposition from Camden residents , the Riverfront State Prison was opened in 1985 and the trash-to-steam plant opened in 1989 . With the addition of the trash-to-steam plant Camden has faced numerous air and water pollution issues . Camden is also the home of a waste-water treatment facility . In the 1970s , dangerous pollutants were found in the wells from which many Camden citizens received their household water . These pollutants decreased property values in Camden and caused health problems among the city 's residents . Pollution is an ongoing issue that local nonprofits are trying to solve .   Camden is home to hospitals , schools , and attractions . The Camden waterfront holds four tourist attractions , the USS New Jersey ; the BB&T Pavilion ; Campbell 's Field ; and the Adventure Aquarium . Until recently Campbell 's field was home to the Camden Riversharks . The city is the home of Rutgers University -- Camden , which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926 , and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University , which opened in 2012 . Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center . The `` eds and meds '' institutions account for roughly 45 % of Camden 's total employment . Forty percent of Camden residents are living below the national poverty line . -LSB- 33 -RSB- Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012 , with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people , -LSB- 34 -RSB- 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens . -LSB- 35 -RSB-   Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party . Voter turnout is very low ; approximately 50 % of Camden 's registered voters participated in the 2016 General Election . Three of Camden 's mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 . -LSB- 28 -RSB- From 2005 to 2012 , the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey . -LSB- 29 -RSB- -LSB- 30 -RSB- -LSB- 31 -RSB- -LSB- 32 -RSB- In 2015 Mayor Dana L.

As Chancellor of the Exchequer -LRB- 1908 -- 1915 -RRB- , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government -LRB- 1916 -- 22 -RRB- , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers .   Historian Martin Pugh in The Oxford Companion to British History argues that :  He made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system -LRB- especially medical insurance , unemployment insurance , and old-age pensions , largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land -RRB- . Furthermore , in foreign affairs he played a leading role in winning the First World War , redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference , and partitioning Ireland .   As Prime Minister , Lloyd George favoured the Conservatives in his coalition in the 1918 elections , leaving the Liberal Party a minority . He became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , but it grew even smaller and more divided . By the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure . He gave weak support to the Second World War amidst fears that he was favourable toward Germany .   He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .

{"id": "Libya", "text": "Libya is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa , bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north , Egypt to the east , Sudan to the southeast , Chad and Niger to the south and Algeria and Tunisia to the west . The country is made of three historical regions , Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica . With an area of almost 1.8 e6km2 , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world .   The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The other large city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya .   Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonisation . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 . Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries . Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943 . During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign . The Italian population then went into decline . Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951 .   A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I , beginning a period of sweeping social reform . The most prominent coup figure , Muammar Gaddafi , was ultimately able to have power fully concentrated in his hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution , remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011 , fought by those supporting the government and by forces attempting to overthrow it , in which the rebels were supported by NATO . Since then , Libya has experienced a period of instability . The European Union is involved in an operation intended to disrupt human trafficking networks exploiting refugees fleeing from wars in Africa for Europe .   As part of the ongoing second Libyan Civil War -LRB- 2014 -- present -RRB- , at least two political bodies claim to be the government of Libya . The Council of Deputies is one such government , but it does not hold territory in the capital , Tripoli , instead meeting in the Cyrenaica city of Tobruk . Meanwhile , the UN-backed 2014 General National Congress purports to be the legal continuation of the General National Congress , elected in the 2012 Libyan General National Congress election and dissolved following the June 2014 elections but then reconvened by a minority of its members . The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014 , but the body has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence .   Parts of Libya are outside of either government 's control , with various Islamist , rebel , and tribal militias administering some cities and areas . The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk - and Tripoli-based factions . An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015 . Under the terms of the agreement , a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed , with a view to holding new elections within two years . The leaders of the new government , called the Government of National Accord -LRB- GNA -RRB- , arrived in Tripoli on 5 April 2016 .

A boar -LRB- adult male -RRB- weighs around 350 -- , while a sow -LRB- adult female -RRB- is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .   Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline . For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect . For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures . "}

{"id": "Dub_music", "text": "Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s , and is commonly considered a subgenre , though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae . Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings , usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece , and emphasizing the drum and bass parts -LRB- this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a riddim -RRB- . Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo , reverb , panoramic delay , and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works . It was an early form of popular electronic music .   Dub was pioneered by Osbourne `` King Tubby '' Ruddock , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry , Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s . Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub , and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre . Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy . These producers , especially Ruddock and Perry , looked upon the mixing console as an instrument , manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different .  Dub has influenced many genres of music , including rock -LRB- most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk -RRB- , pop , hip hop , disco , and later house , techno , ambient , electronic dance music , and trip hop . Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived , and some of the originators , such as Lee `` Scratch '' Perry and Mad Professor , continue to produce new material .

Born in Osaka Prefecture , his prolific output , pioneering techniques , and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as `` the father of manga '' , `` the godfather of manga '' and `` the god of manga '' . Additionally , he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney , who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka 's formative years .   Born in Toyonaka Tezuka took an interest in art and animation at an early age when his father showed him his first Disney films . As a young child Tezuka began to practice drawing so much that his mother would have to erase pages in his notebook in order to keep up with his output . In elementary school he would develop his own comics and illustrations from which his skills would become formidable . During high school in 1944 Tezuka was drafted into the military service to work in a factory . Tezuka would begin studying medicine at the Osaka University in 1945 , during which he would begin to publish his first professional works . Tezuka would begin what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947 . His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential , successful and well received manga series including Astro Boy , Jungle Emperor Leo , Black Jack , and Phoenix , all of which would win several awards .   During the 1960s Tezuka entered the animation industry in Japan by founding the production company Mushi Productions he would help innovate with industry with the broadcast of the animated version of Astro Boy in 1963 . This series would create the first successful model for animation production in Japan and would also be the first Japanese animation dubbed into English for an American audience . Other series were also translated to animation including Jungle Emperor Leo , the first Japanese animated series produced in full color . In the 1970s Mushi Productions would collapse financially and the fallout would produce several influential animation production studios including Sunrise . After Mushi Production 's failure Tezuka would found Tezuka Productions and continue experimenting with animation late into his life .   Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989 . His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public . A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works and Tezuka received many posthumous awards . Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix which were never released . "}

The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers , as opposed to other data , such as images or data contained in databases . It was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997 . Google Search provides several features beyond searching for words . These include synonyms , weather forecasts , time zones , stock quotes , maps , earthquake data , movie showtimes , airports , home listings , and sports scores . There are special features for numbers , dates , and some specific forms , including ranges , prices , temperatures , money and measurement unit conversions , calculations , package tracking , patents , area codes , and language translation .

Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces , Vojvodina and Kosovo , which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation . After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism , Yugoslavia broke up along its republics ' borders , at first into five countries , leading to the Yugoslav Wars .   After the breakup , the republics of Serbia and Montenegro formed a reduced federation , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -LRB- FRY -RRB- , which aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY , but those claims were opposed by the other former republics . Eventually , Serbia and Montenegro accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession . Serbia and Montenegro themselves broke up in 2006 and became independent states , while Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 . "}

The Times and The Sunday Times do not share editorial staff , were founded independently and have only had common ownership since 1967 .   In 1959 the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of The Times in shaping the views of events of London 's elite :   For much more than a century The Times has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain . Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated , and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility . While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns , its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain . To guide this treatment , the editors have for long periods been in close touch with 10 Downing Street .   The Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name , lending it to numerous other papers around the world , including The Times of India -LRB- founded in 1838 -RRB- , The Straits Times -LRB- Singapore -RRB- -LRB- 1845 -RRB- , The New York Times -LRB- 1851 -RRB- , The Irish Times -LRB- 1859 -RRB- , Le Temps -LRB- France -RRB- -LRB- 1861-1942 -RRB- , the Cape Times -LRB- South Africa -RRB- -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , the Los Angeles Times -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , the Trenton Times -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , The Seattle Times -LRB- 1891 -RRB- , The Manila Times -LRB- 1898 -RRB- , The Daily Times -LRB- Malawi -RRB- -LRB- 1900 -RRB- , El Tiempo -LRB- Colombia -RRB- -LRB- 1911 -RRB- , The Canberra Times -LRB- 1926 -RRB- , Times of Malta -LRB- 1935 -RRB- , and The Washington Times -LRB- 1982 -RRB- .

The Times is the originator of the widely used Times Roman typeface , originally developed by Stanley Morison of The Times in collaboration with the Monotype Corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing . In November 2006 The Times began printing headlines in a new font , Times Modern . The Times was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years , but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport . The Sunday Times remains a broadsheet .   The Times had an average daily circulation of 446,164 in December 2016 ; in the same period , The Sunday Times had an average daily circulation of 792,210 . An American edition of The Times has been published since 6 June 2006 .

{"id": "Joseph_Merrick", "text": "Joseph Carey Merrick -LRB- 5 August 1862 -- 11 April 1890 ; often incorrectly called John Merrick -RRB- was an English man with very severe deformities who was first exhibited at a freak show as the `` Elephant Man '' , and then went to live at the London Hospital after he met Frederick Treves , so becoming well known in London society . Merrick was born in Leicester , and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life : his skin appeared thick and lumpy , he developed enlarged lips , and a bony lump grew on his forehead , one of his arms and both of his feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip , resulting in permanent lameness . When he was 9 , his mother died from bronchopneumonia , and his father soon remarried . Merrick left school at the age of 13 and had difficulty finding employment . Rejected by his father and stepmother , he left home . In late 1879 , Merrick , aged 17 , entered the Leicester Union Workhouse .   In 1884 , after four years in the workhouse , Merrick contacted a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him . Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick , whom they named the Elephant Man . After touring the East Midlands , Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman . Norman 's shop , directly across the street from the London Hospital , was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves , who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed . Soon after Merrick 's visits to the hospital , Tom Norman 's shop was closed by the police , and Merrick 's managers sent him to tour in Europe .   In Belgium , Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in Brussels . He eventually made his way back to London ; unable to communicate , he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves 's card on him . Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital . Although his condition was incurable , Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life . Treves visited him daily , and the pair developed quite a close friendship . Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society , including Alexandra , Princess of Wales .   Merrick died on 11 April 1890 , aged 27 . Although the official cause of his death was asphyxia , Treves , who performed the autopsy on the body , said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck . He believed that Merrick , who had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head , had been attempting to sleep lying down to `` be like other people '' . In absence of the possibility of genetic tests , the exact cause of Merrick 's deformities has long been unclear , so that throughout much of the 20th century it was speculated that Merrick was affected by other neurological syndromes . Only in 1986 was it conjectured that he had Proteus syndrome , a very rare congenital disorder also known as Wiedemann syndrome -LRB- named after the German pediatrician Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann -RRB- . DNA tests on his hair and bones in 2003 in a study by Charis Eng were inconclusive . Meanwhile , in 1979 , Bernard Pomerance 's play about Merrick called The Elephant Man debuted , and David Lynch 's film , also called The Elephant Man , was released in 1980 . In late 2014 and early 2015 , Bradley Cooper starred in a Broadway revival of The Elephant Man , directed by Scott Ellis . "}
